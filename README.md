# Internal Links Anchor Overlap Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that analyzes overlap in anchor texts within internal links of a website. The script reads a CSV file with columns for 'Source', 'Destination', and 'Anchor', groups the data by the 'Anchor' column, and identifies instances where the same anchor text links to different 'Destination' URLs. These instances are then saved in a new CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage

The script is designed to be run in Google Colab. You can access the Colab notebook directly through this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d2T1YMKYht94y1V7BYi2F7lWZ5i0kCv9#scrollTo=DG_Z8ng-N77d).
